    "* As you can see, building models for machine learning is easy. Building good models for useful results takes time and work. We hiked through the messy processes here of examining a collection of possible variables and experimenting with different feature engineering methods to achieve better results. We define “better” here not just in terms of good outcomes from our training and testing, but also reducing the size of the model and the time it takes us to iterate over different experiments.\n",

We hope that our work has given you the necessary tools to become more efficient and effective, as well as enriched your mathematical and com‐ putational understanding of how feature engineering is an essential skill to develop useful machine learning models."
