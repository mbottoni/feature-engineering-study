    "* The problem with one-hot encoding is that it allows for k degrees of freedom, while the variable itself needs only k–1. Dummy coding2 removes the extra degree of free‐ dom by using only k–1 features in the representation (see Table 5-2). One feature is thrown under the bus and represented by the vector of all zeros. This is known as the reference category.\n",

    "* A hash function is a deterministic function that maps a potentially unbounded inte‐ ger to a finite integer range [1, m]. Since the input domain is potentially larger than the output range, multiple numbers may get mapped to the same output. This is called a collision. A uniform hash function ensures that roughly the same number of numbers are mapped into each of the m bins."

    "Just like rare words, rare categories require special treatment. Think about a user who logs in once a year: there will be very little data to reliably estimate that user’s click- through rate for ads. Moreover, rare categories waste space in the counts table.\n",
    "One way to deal with this is through back-off, a simple technique that accumulates the counts of all rare categories in a special bin (see Figure 5-3). If the count is greater than a certain threshold, then the category gets its own count statistics. Otherwise, we use the statistics from the back-off bin. This essentially reverts the statistics for a sin‐ gle rare category to the statistics computed on all rare categories. When using the back-off method, it helps to also add a binary indicator for whether or not the statis‐ tics come from the back-off bin."
